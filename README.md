# MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine

## Description

This project is a transformation of a Google Books API search engine, initially built with a RESTful API, into a more dynamic version using a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The challenge encompassed refactoring the existing application to enhance performance and user experience. Through this project, I have deepened my understanding of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and honed my skills in GraphQL and Apollo Server.
